# Multimeter

The project was realized by a team of five first semester students at University of Southern Denmark, studying electronics engineering. At the beginning of the semester, a meeting was organized, to distribute the tasks, so each member of the team had been working on a different part of the project, from enclosure design to PCB design and programming. The final report was a compilation of the parts written by each peer about what they worked on. In addition, an introduction and ending was written.  

The Gantt chart was used to showcase the project timeline and to make sure the team is in time to finalize the project within the given timeframe. It can be seen in the following picture:

There was a fixed budget from the university of 1k DKK to order components necessary for the PCB and enclosure. As it can be seen in the following picture, only 245 DKK out of the total budget of 1000 DKK were used.

For designing the PCB, KiCad was used; a schematic and a PCB layout has been generated:

In the final weeks prior to the exam, everything was put together and the multimeter was powered ON. This allowed for testing of the different modes: voltmeter, currentmeter and resistancemeter. The results can be seen in the following pictures:
