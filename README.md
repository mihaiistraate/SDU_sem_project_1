# Multimeter

The development of high-tech devices plays an essential role in the modern world. One of these devices is a multimeter, which has been the focus of this semester project. Throughout this journey, not only technical skills have been used, but also teamwork and collaboration, as the multifunctional digital multimeter was designed, built, and evaluated.

The primary objective was to develop a digital multimeter, which is an electronic device that can measure several electronic components or electrical properties. Typical multimeters can measure a current, a voltage and more. In order to fulfil the requirements of the assignment, it was mandatory to measure four electronic properties, of which two of these properties were mandatory (resistance and voltage). The last two were voluntarily chosen by us. Current and temperature have been chosen to enhance the versatility of our device, making it more comprehensive tool for various diagnostic and experimental scenarios.

The process of the product had four main stages, which are research, designing, building and testing. The Gantt chart was used to showcase the project timeline and to make sure the team is in time to finalize the project within the given timeframe. It can be seen in the following picture:

There was a fixed budget from the university of 1k DKK to order components necessary for the PCB and enclosure. As it can be seen in the following picture, only 245 DKK out of the total budget of 1000 DKK were used.

In the research phase, information was collected from the different scientific theories taught during classes; additionally further research was done for specific purposes. Hereafter the project started to take shape, designing and gathering all the material, which was a necessity to construct the multimeter. This phase gave a better insight in how a multimeter works, and how planning should be done to meet the given requirements.

During the designing phase, a schematic was created, which was later used for building a whole circuit. KiCad was used; a schematic and a PCB layout have been generated:

Moreover, we had to 3D print the case, which allowed us to tailor the design to the specific needs of the project and to explore the possibilities of contemporary fabrication methods. In addition, the code writing process started. This process allowed for an understanding of the balance between aesthetic appeal, ergonomic efficiency, and structural integrity.

The building phase was divided into 3 stages. Firstly, soldering of the PCB was started. Secondly, the code was completed. Lastly, the elements were integrated and the components assembled into the 3D printed case. This phase was undoubtedly the most troublesome in response to unexpected issues, and the students gained a lot of profound knowledge in problem-solving.

Nearing conclusion, only calibratation and conducting testing was needed for the multimeter. During the calibration process, various scenarios have been simulated to ensure that criteria of accuracy and reliability for standard multimeter was fulfilled by the product. The results can be seen in the following pictures:
